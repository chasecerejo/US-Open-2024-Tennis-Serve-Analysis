## üìä Results ‚Äî US Open 2024 Serve Analysis

**Dataset & Cleaning**  
Source: 2024 US Open point-level and match-level data (Jeff Sackmann).  
Filters:
- Drop rows with missing `Speed_KMH`, `ServeWidth`, `PointWinner`, `PointServer`
- Keep valid `PointWinner`/`PointServer` ‚àà {1, 2}
- Remove low-speed outliers: `Speed_KMH` ‚â§ 100

Final sample: **38,997 serve points**  
Server won: **24,840 (63.7%)** ‚Ä¢ Server lost: **14,157 (36.3%)**  
Overall serve-win rate: **63.7%**

**Leaderboard**  
- `best_servers` table ranks players by serve-win % (min **50** serves).  
- Figure: **Top 15 Servers by Serve Win % (min 50 serves)**.

Artifacts (saved by the script):  
- **Leaderboard CSV:** `artifacts/usopen2024_serve_leaderboard.csv`  
- **Figure:** `artifacts/usopen2024_top15_servers.png`

**Exploratory Models (CART & Random Forest)**  
Features: `Speed_KMH`, `ServeWidth`, `CourtSide`  
- **CART**: for interpretability.  
- **Random Forest (100 trees)**  
  - OOB error: **36.31%** (‚âà **63.69%** accuracy)  
  - Test accuracy: **0.637** (‚âà overall serve-win rate)  
  - **Baseline:** predicting ‚Äúserver wins‚Äù for every point also yields ‚âà **0.637** ‚Üí model behavior matches class imbalance  
  - **Brier score:** **0.3442**  
  - **Variable importance:** `Speed_KMH` and `ServeWidth` dominate; `CourtSide` minor contribution

**Interpretation**  
- Descriptives answer ‚Äúwho serves best‚Äù more directly than classification here.  
- Faster + well-placed serves correlate with point wins, but with only 3 features and an imbalanced target, RF essentially approximates the majority class.

**Limitations**  
- Speed cutoff may drop a few true slow second serves.  
- No rebalancing/tuning; models shown for intuition, not SOTA prediction.  
- Not split by draw (Men/Women) yet.

**Key Takeaways**  
- Serve dominance is real: **~63.7%** server win rate overall.  
- Top servers clearly separate on the leaderboard.  
- Among tested features, **speed and width** matter most.

**Reproducibility**  
- Put data in `data/`:  
  - `data/2024-usopen-points.csv`  
  - `data/2024-usopen-matches.csv`  
- Run `USOpen2024TennisServeAnalysisProject.R` (saves artifacts to `artifacts/`).  
- R `sessionInfo()` included below for versions.
